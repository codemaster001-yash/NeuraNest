# NeuraNest 🧠✨ - Your Pocket-Sized Cognitive Gym

Ever feel like your brain could use a good stretch? Not with dusty textbooks or stressful quizzes, but with something... fun?

Welcome to **NeuraNest**, a sleek, minimalist web application designed to be a digital playground for your neurons. This isn't about what you know; it's about *how you think*. Through a series of beautifully designed, intuitive games, NeuraNest targets core cognitive domains like memory, logic, pattern recognition, and spatial awareness.

It’s a mindful, calming experience for all ages, from toddlers learning to track colors to seniors keeping their minds sharp.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

NeuraNest was built with a "calm-tech" philosophy. The goal was to create a serene and non-intimidating digital space. We've used:

  * A soothing, futuristic color palette.
  * Subtle **glassmorphism** effects for a clean, modern feel.
  * **Motion-driven UI:** Every transition is powered by GSAP to be fluid and intuitive, guiding the user's focus without being distracting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a lightweight, high-performance **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with a focus on fundamentals. No heavy frameworks, just pure web technologies.

  * 🏛️ **Architecture:** Vanilla JavaScript SPA (no frameworks\!)
  * 🎨 **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first, responsive layout.
  * 🚀 **Animations:** **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for all UI transitions and effects.
  * 📊 **Charts:** **Chart.js** for beautiful and interactive data visualizations.
  * 💾 **Storage:** All user data (name, scores, settings) is stored client-side in **Browser `localStorage`**.

The app runs entirely from a **single `index.html` file**. Views are managed using `<template>` elements and dynamically rendered with JavaScript, creating a fast, app-like experience without a complex build process.
